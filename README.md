# SOLID Principles Hands-on Repository ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to understanding and applying the **SOLID** principles in object-oriented programming through hands-on examples. Rather than just presenting correct implementations, this repo explores **both incorrect (violating SOLID) and correct (following SOLID) examples** to illustrate the importance of these principles.

## ðŸ“Œ What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of five design principles that improve the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of object-oriented code:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (**SRP**) - A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (**OCP**) - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (**LSP**) - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (**ISP**) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (**DIP**) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
